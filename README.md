## Trading Strategies

Passive Bot can implement various trading strategies to maximize your profits. Here are a few strategies you might consider:

### 1. Simple Arbitrage

This strategy involves buying an asset on one exchange where the price is lower and selling it on another exchange where the price is higher.

### 2. Triangular Arbitrage

Involves trading between three currencies to exploit discrepancies in their exchange rates. This can be more complex but often yields higher profits.

### 3. Statistical Arbitrage

Uses statistical models to predict price movements and take advantage of price inefficiencies. This requires a deeper understanding of market behavior.
